# Exam Scheduler 
## Meeting #1 - 30/10/2017

We need to make an EXAM scheduler and *not* a general lecture & tutorial scheduler.
The current way (before the project) to avoid exam collisions is to go over a huge amount of papers = manual work.
We receive basic information from Ullman regarding exams (for 1st and 2nd semester courses like Algebra) that were already scheduled, and we need to schedule the *faculty courses* with those constraints.

We need to make sure there as few collisions as possible (none if possible) - for example if Algebra was already scheduled we need to look at the מערכת מומלצת of the 1st semester and try to position them accordingly. (repeat for every semester)

Courses from entirely different semesters (like Software Design and Physics 1) can and most likely will collide and that's OK.
The demands and features of the project are our responsibility.
We need to work with the needs of the customer (hard constraints). The input is probably the Ullman basic courses input and the faculty catalogue.

We need to plan the best way to receive the catalogue input- as a single file with all of the courses (as WORD/PDF etc) or something more dynamic.

**NICE TO HAVE** - If a lecturer informs us he is abroad in a certain week we (possibly, maybe only for lecturers in charge) won't schedule exams during that week.
Tanya will send us text input for reference.

**Next week**-
We will meet Mika (the customer) and see how she works at the moment. Need to come prepared with a list of features and questions.
